A.H and I went on a walk in the Tiergarten. It was a sunny but cold morning. A week ago I had twisted my ankle while rushing down the Spreebrücke Bahnhof Friedrichstraße. I was strolling in the supermarket, taking deliberate time picking groceries, having forgotten about a work meeting I had at 3 PM on a Friday, until Google Calendar reminded me about it. The pain had receded since, but I was still limping slightly. 
A.H. was aware of the accident and was sweet enough to remind me to walk slowly, also matching pace with me. 

We were both admiring how beautiful the park was and we agreed that it would be even more pleasant during the summer months. We resolved to visit again in summer. 
The topic of conversation moved from the weather and the surroundings to books. A.H. shared that she's been reading a book called "Why We Sleep" and has been finding it quite interesting.
I told her about "The Remains of The Day" which I had recently finished reading.
Now that I think back, I realize we did not abruptly switch from commenting on the weather to discussing books. 
It happened when a site, that we both felt would be very conducive to reading, presented itself: 
While walking along the pond in the garden we spotted a cozy spot on the tiny bridge over it. A tall tree on the bank of the pond close to the bridge loomed over our spot, rendering it shady and safe. We walked up there and stood resting against the railing, looking down at the water reflecting the tree and us.
